# Google Sheets Automation: Link Tracker & Notification

## Overview
This project is a Google Apps Script designed to automate task tracking and management within a Google Sheet. It streamlines workflows by:

- Locking certain columns to prevent manual edits.
- Automatically recording date and time when a task is selected.
- Validating URLs entered in the sheet.
- Calculating and displaying the time taken to complete a task.
- Sending automated email alerts if a valid link isnâ€™t provided within 5 minutes.

This script is ideal for content calendars, project tracking, or any workflow where timely link submission and task monitoring are critical.

## How It Works

| Column | Purpose                                 | Behavior                                               |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| A      | Task selection                         | Editable once; locks after first edit.                |
| B      | Time of task selection                 | Auto-filled when column A is edited.                   |
| C      | Date of task selection                 | Auto-filled when column A is edited.                   |
| D      | Link submission                       | User inputs a valid URL here; validated automatically. |
| E      | Time taken for task completion        | Calculates difference between Aâ€™s timestamp and Dâ€™s entry time. |
